## Example Flask app to query Foursquare and display response in web page

* Create and activate a virtual environment
* Install requirements with ``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
* Add your client key and secret to fs.py. In a real app, you'll need to manage these securely
* Create an environment variable called FLASK_APP with value app.py. On Windows this might be ``` set FLASK_APP=app.py ```. Or you can configure through computer settings. 
* Type ``` flask run ``` to run server
* App should be running at 127.0.0.1:5000
